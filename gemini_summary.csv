3. TOP PERFORMERS:
The top 5 students based on their 'Total' score are:
1.  Yash Agarwal: 97.50
2.  Akshat Rai: 97.38
3.  Pranavishvar H: 95.00
4.  Fathima Minha: 93.88
5.  Tushar Dhanuka: 91.50

4. PERFORMANCE PATTERNS:
*   **Quiz 1 (10) and Quiz 2 (10)**: There is a very strong positive correlation between 'Quiz 1 (10)' and 'Quiz 2 (10)'. For almost all students, the scores for Quiz 1 and Quiz 2 are identical, suggesting they might be the same assessment, or that performance is consistent across these two components. For example, Yash Agarwal scored 10.00 in both, Akshat Rai scored 9.50 in both, and Suryansh Kulshreshtha scored 5.50 in both.
*   **Normalized Mid sem (30) and End Sem (40)**: There appears to be a general positive correlation between 'Normalized Mid sem (30)' and 'End Sem (40)'. Students who performed well in the Mid-sem generally tend to perform well in the End Sem, and vice-versa. For instance, Yash Agarwal scored 30.00 in Mid sem and 38.00 in End Sem, while Rajarshi Chakraborty scored 7.50 in Mid sem and 12.00 in End Sem. However, there are exceptions, such as Sanjib Behera who scored 21.38 in Mid sem but 38.50 in End Sem, or Maradugu Varshitha Lakshmi with 15.75 in Mid sem and 28.00 in End Sem, indicating that some students significantly improve or decline in the End Sem regardless of their Mid-sem performance.
*   **Overall Trends**: The 'Total' score generally reflects the combined performance across all assessments. Students consistently scoring high in quizzes and mid-sem tend to have higher overall totals. The 'End Sem (40)' component (and its normalized version 'End_Sem (50)') carries the highest weight, and good performance here significantly boosts the 'Total' score.

5. OUTLIERS:
*   **Unusually Low Scores (0.00 across all components)**: Sudhanshu Kumar, Boddepalli Govardhan, and Utkarsh Raj Bind have 0.00 in all grading components and a total score of 0.00. This could indicate non-submission, absence, or data entry errors.
*   **Very Low Quiz Scores**: Suryansh Kulshreshtha scored 5.50 in both Quiz 1 and Quiz 2, which is significantly lower than the average of 8.00.
*   **Low Mid-Sem Scores**:
    *   Bhukya Veerendar Nayak: 6.00 (Normalized Mid sem)
    *   Rajarshi Chakraborty: 7.50 (Normalized Mid sem)
    *   Shivam Raj: 11.25 (Normalized Mid sem)
    *   Komal Jatav: 12.00 (Normalized Mid sem)
    *   Tirthankar Mandal: 12.00 (Normalized Mid sem)
    These are considerably below the average of 22.84.
*   **Low End-Sem Scores**:
    *   Rajarshi Chakraborty: 12.00 (End Sem)
    *   Ritik Kumar: 13.00 (End Sem)
    *   Saurabh Gupta: 14.00 (End Sem)
    *   D S Ram Sri Supreme: 15.00 (End Sem)
    These are notably lower than the average of 28.18.
*   **High End-Sem Scores (relative to Mid-sem)**: Sanjib Behera had a relatively low Normalized Mid sem score of 21.38 but achieved a high End Sem score of 38.50, indicating a significant improvement or strong performance in the final exam.
*   **High Total Scores**: Yash Agarwal (97.50), Akshat Rai (97.38), and Pranavishvar H (95.00) are clear top performers, with scores significantly above the average total of 71.02.

6. RECOMMENDATIONS:
*   **Investigate Zero Scores**: The instructors should investigate the three students with 0.00 scores across all components (Sudhanshu Kumar, Boddepalli Govardhan, Utkarsh Raj Bind) to understand if these are data entry errors, non-participation, or other issues.
*   **Quiz Consistency**: Given the near-identical scores for 'Quiz 1 (10)' and 'Quiz 2 (10)', it would be beneficial to clarify if these are intended to be separate assessments of similar difficulty or if there's an underlying reason for the score duplication.
*   **Identify Struggling Students Early**: Students with consistently low scores in quizzes and mid-sem (e.g., Suryansh Kulshreshtha in quizzes, Bhukya Veerendar Nayak in mid-sem) should be identified early for potential intervention or support.
*   **Analyze End-Sem Performance**: While there's a general correlation, some students show significant shifts in performance between mid-sem and end-sem. Understanding the reasons for these shifts (e.g., improved study habits, difficulty of material, exam anxiety) could provide valuable insights.
*   **Reinforce High Performers**: Acknowledge and potentially use the strategies of top performers like Yash Agarwal and Akshat Rai as examples for other students.
*   **Weighting Impact**: The 'End Sem (40)' component has a substantial impact on the 'Total' score. Students who perform poorly in earlier assessments but excel in the End Sem can still achieve a respectable total. Conversely, strong early performance can be undermined by a weak End Sem. This should be communicated to students to emphasize the importance of consistent effort.","1761228319730","1"
